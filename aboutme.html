      <p>
        Born in Ankara, Turkey. I have always been interested in engineering,
        games and music since my childhood. When I was in secondary school, I
        lived out of town for 2 years, other than that, I always lived in
        Ankara. I was interested in computer engineering and wanted to study in
        this department. So far I have been interested in mobile application
        development and crypto.
